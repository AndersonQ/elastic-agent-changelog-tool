      the installation ways described in [`./install.md`](./install.md).\n+\n+## 3.
      Create a changelog fragment\n+\n+From the root folder of the repository run:\n+\n+```\n+$
      elastic-agent-changelog-tool new \"my test fragment\"\n+```\n+\n+This will create
      `./changelog/fragments/<timestamp>-my-test-fragment.yaml` with this content:\n+\n+```yaml\n+#
      one of:\n+# - breaking-change: a change to previously-documented behavior\n+#
      - deprecation: functionality that is being removed in a later release\n+# -
      bug-fix: fixes a problem in a previous version\n+# - enhancement: extends functionality
      but does not break or fix existing behavior\n+# - feature: new functionality\n+#
      - known-issue: problems that we are aware of in a given version\n+# - security:
      impacts on the security of a product or a user’s deployment.\n+# - upgrade:
      important information for someone upgrading from a prior version\n+# - other:

      the maintainer needs to verify the proper changelog fragment is provided in
      PRs and may want to review the unreleased changelog\n+- the release manager
