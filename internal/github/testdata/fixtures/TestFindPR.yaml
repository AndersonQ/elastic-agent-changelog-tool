      label this PR with one of the following labels, depending on the scope of your
      change:\r\n- Bug\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis pull requests allow
      to use metricbeat with MSSQL and named instances.\r\n\r\n## Why is it important?\r\n\r\nBigger
      companies often don''t use MSSQL in a docker container. Often they have one
      server with multiple named instances. This change allows them to use metricbeat
      as well.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n~~- [ ] My code follows the style guidelines
